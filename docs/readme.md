# gitup

## Synopsis

`gitup` is a tool to help you manage git repositories that you only consume.
I found that I have a few git repositories that I never really contribute to, but
only need a copy of the latest master/stable branch, and this tool allows you
to manage and update all of these repositories at once.

This is great for miscellaneous git based projects that don't quite fit in any
of your other package managers, but you want to easily update.

## Usage

(WIP)

## Development

This is a standard Rust/Cargo project. To build the project locally:

```sh
cargo build --release
```
